## Overview

Brick is a payment gateway built on the Solana blockchain, facilitating the seamless creation and management of marketplaces to effectively monetize a wide array of products and services.

## Marketplace customization
Marketplace creators have the freedom to customize their platforms based on their specific requirements. 

The following customizable features are available:
  
- **Permissionless Access**: Marketplaces can opt for a permissionless model, allowing anyone to sell on the platform without the need for verification like KYC. Alternatively, a token gate or KYC process can be implemented for controlled access.

- **Rewards or Cashback**: Marketplaces can incentivize users by offering rewards or cashback for their purchases on the platform, enhancing user engagement and loyalty.

- **Transaction Fees**: The marketplace has the flexibility to set transaction fees for facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. This allows marketplaces to generate revenue from the platform operations.
  
- **Secondary Market Support**: Marketplaces can decide whether products or services can be resold, thereby creating a secondary market for items. When users register a purchase, a fungible token is minted to the user, granting them access to the specific product or service.

- **Metadata Support**: Tokens within the marketplace can be enriched with multimedia representations such as images and videos. This feature is particularly useful for video game marketplaces where tokens can represent in-game items like skins, covers, etc.
